# What is GHOST? #
---

GHOST stands for General, Hybrid and Optimized Sparse Toolkit. It provides
basic building blocks for computation with very large sparse or dense matrices. GHOST
is being developed as part of the [ESSEX](http://blogs.fau.de/essex/) project
under the umbrella of the Priority Programme 1648: Software for Exascale
Computing ([SPPEXA](http://www.sppexa.de/)) of the German Research Foundation (DFG).

# Examples #
---

Have a look at the [GHOST-Apps](https://bitbucket.org/essex/ghost-apps) and the [PHYSICS](https://bitbucket.org/essex/physics) project for some example applications using GHOST.

Also check out [PHIST](https://bitbucket.org/essex/phist), the sparse iterative solver toolkit
from the ESSEX project which supports GHOST as a kernel library.

# Dependencies and optional packages #
---

1. A C/C++ compiler
1. Perl (for automatic code generation)
1. [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) >= 2.8
1. [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc) >= 1.7 (older versions *may* work as well) ([Install notes](https://bitbucket.org/essex/ghost/wiki/Dependencies))
1. A BLAS library (e.g., [Intel MKL](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl) (preferred) or [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/))

In order to use GHOST at its best and make use of the full functionality 
you can decide to enable (some of) the following optional dependencies:

1. An OpenMP-3.1-capable C/C++ compiler
1. MPI ([Tested versions](https://bitbucket.org/essex/ghost/wiki/Compatibility))
1. [CUDA](http://www.nvidia.com/cuda) for employing GPU computation ([Tested versions](https://bitbucket.org/essex/ghost/wiki/Compatibility))
1. [Zoltan](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/zoltan/) for sparse matrix re-ordering based on hypergraphs
1. [SCOTCH](http://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/) for sparse matrix re-ordering ([Tested versions](https://bitbucket.org/essex/ghost/wiki/Compatibility), [Install notes](https://bitbucket.org/essex/ghost/wiki/Dependencies))
1. [ColPack](http://cscapes.cs.purdue.edu/coloringpage/software.htm) for sparse matrix coloring which is required for the CARP kernel.

# Documentation #
---

The main point of documentation is located in the Doxygen pages: [https://mkreutzer.bitbucket.io/ghost_doc/](https://mkreutzer.bitbucket.io/ghost_doc/).

Our preprint available at the arXiv describes a lot of the concepts of GHOST: [arxiv.org/abs/1507.08101](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08101).

Information on some specific topics which are not necessarily related to the GHOST API and concepts can be found in the [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/essex/ghost/wiki) pages on Bitbucket.

Note that the API documentation can be generated by switching to the build/ directory of your checked out code (see installation documentation below) and type `make doc` (Doxygen must be available). You can then open `doc/html/index.html` with a web browser.

---
# Installation #
---

First of all, clone the git repository:

`git clone git@bitbucket.org:essex/ghost.git && cd ghost/`

It is preferrable to perform an out-of-source build, i.e., create a build directory first:

`mkdir build && cd build/`

You can find [installation instructions for specific machines](https://bitbucket.org/essex/ghost/wiki/Installation%20instructions) in the wiki.
To do a quick build with the system compilers, MPI and OpenMP enabled, and the default settings for code generation:

`cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where-to-install>`

Once the Makefile is present you can type `make && make install`.

You can test your build with `make check`.

You can toggle shared/static libs with `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON/OFF` (default: shared).

For interactive specification of build options and variables, use ccmake to configure and generate a Makefile:

`ccmake ..`

See the information about [Code generation](http://mkreutzer.bitbucket.org/ghost_docs/md__home_hpc_unrz_unrza317_proj_ESSEX_ghost_doxygen_codegeneration.html) for details on how to generate fast kernels.

If you do not want to use the system compilers, invoke (c)cmake as follows (e.g., Intel Compilers):

`CC=icc CXX=icpc ccmake ..`

The build system will try to find a Cblas header `*cblas.h` in default locations.
In some cases (if MKL or GSL Cblas is detected), a hint about the necessary BLAS libraries will be created for the future build of executables which link to GHOST.
If finding a Cblas header fails, or if you want to overwrite the found Cblas header, you can pass `-DCBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR=<dir-of-cblas-header>` to (c)cmake or set the value in ccmake.
If the detected Cblas is neither MKL or GSL, the variable `BLAS_LIBRARIES` has to be set manually before linking any application to GHOST.

The same applies for hwloc and the variables `HWLOC_INCLUDE_DIR` and `HWLOC_LIBRARIES`.

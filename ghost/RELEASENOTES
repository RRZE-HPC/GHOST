	Release Version 0.2


	+ Arbitrary data types at runtime (currently only test with CRS for CPUs 
			and BJDS for CUDA)

	+ Initial Fortran support (thanks to Jonas)

	+ Initial support for the IBM Power architecture

	+ Vectors:
		+ Vectors now have a 'class-like' structure just as matrices
		+ Added vector I/O
		+ Added several initialization functions: fromScalar, fromFunc, 
			fromFile, fromRand
		+ Generalization of vectors to multi-vectors (further generaliztation
			to dense matrices to come)

	+ De-coupling of matrix from context

	+ MPI-enabled operations
		+ spMVM
		+ dot product
		+ normalize vector

	+ CUDA+MPI-enabled operations
		+ spMVM

	+ Utility functions
		+ ghost_pinThreads
		+ ghost_printMatrixInfo
		- ghost_printOptionsInfo

	+ Utility macros
		+ Manage data types: GHOST_REGISTER_DT_S/D/Z/C
		+ Create matrix/vector traits: GHOST_M/VTRAITS_INIT

	+ Many bugfixes and small improvements (check git log for details)

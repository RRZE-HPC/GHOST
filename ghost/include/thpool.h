/* Description: Library providing a threading pool where you can add work on the fly. The number
 *              of threads in the pool is adjustable when creating the pool. In most cases
 *              this should equal the number of threads supported by your cpu.
 *          
 *              For an example on how to use the threadpool, check the main.c file or just read
 *              the documentation.
 * 
 *              In this header file a detailed overview of the functions and the threadpool logical
 *              scheme is present in case tweaking of the pool is needed.

 * thpool_t     = threadpool type
 * tp_p         = threadpool pointer
 * sem          = semaphore

 *    Description:       Jobs are added to the job queue. Once a thread in the pool
 *                       is idle, it is assigned with the first job from the queue(and
 *                       erased from the queue). It's each thread's job to read from 
 *                       the queue serially(using lock) and executing each job
 *                       until the queue is empty.

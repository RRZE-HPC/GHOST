== HEADERS ==
  There are 2 headers which you may need in your programs:
  1) spmvm.h
     This header includes the most basic data structures, prototypes and macros 
	 you will need in any case.
  2) spmvm_util.h
     This header includes utility functions and macros that may be helpful
	 when using LibSpMVM in certain cases. 
	 This includes, e.g., functions for setting up and using vector types, 
	 printing information about the matrix, plugging in user-defined kernels,
	 and many more.

== INPUT DATA ==
  There are two matrix file formats which are supported:
    1) Matrix Market
	   This is an ASCII format for matrices which is documented here:
	   http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html
    2) binary CRS
	   This format stores the matrix as CRS (binary) and looks as 
	   follows:
	     4 bytes: an integer defining the datatype for the matrix entries
		 4 bytes: an integer telling the number of rows (N) of the matrix
		 4 bytes: an integer telling the number of columns (M) of the matrix
		 4 bytes: an integer telling the number of non-zero entries of the matrix

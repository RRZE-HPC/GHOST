== HEADERS ==
  There are 2 headers which you may need in your programs:
  1) spmvm.h
     This header includes the most basic data structures, prototypes and macros 
	 you will need in any case.
  2) spmvm_util.h
     This header includes utility functions and macros that may be helpful
	 when using LibSpMVM in certain cases. 
	 This includes, e.g., functions for setting up and using vector types, 
	 printing information about the matrix, plugging in user-defined kernels,
	 and many more.
